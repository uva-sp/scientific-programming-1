# Monopoly (level 3) #


**Checkpy for this module will be added Monday 30 September.**

After a short introduction with animating in Python, we'll spend the first 3 days of this module on simulating the game of Monopoly. It is impossible to do so analytically, because the use of dice adds a complicated element of chance to the game. Game theory in practice.

During day 4 we'll get acquainted with simulating a physical phenomenon: free fall (with and without friction).

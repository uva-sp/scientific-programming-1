# Population dynamics (level 3)

This module is a BETA version!

In this module we'll simulate the population dynamics of 25 rabbits and 2 foxes, living in a secluded forest. A classic predator-prey model with a variety of elements and an animation.

In the video below, meet [Iko Koevoets](http://www.uva.nl/over-de-uva/organisatie/medewerkers/content/k/o/i.t.koevoets/i.t.koevoets.html) who studies the development of plant roots. Data processing is at the core of her research.
